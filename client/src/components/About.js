        <h1>What is Caffiene</h1>
      <h2>Caffeine is naturally found in the leaves and fruits of some plants. It is in coffee, black and green tea, cocoa, cola soft drinks and energy drinks. It may also be in chocolate bars, energy bars and some non-prescription medications, such as cough syrup and slimming tablets. Guarana (a popular additive in energy drinks) is also a natural source of caffeine.<a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/caffeine">Link to article</a></h2>
